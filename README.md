# StonkBot 99% finished. Just need to make it look pretty and export the data to an infographic instead of reading it manually from console. 
# You can change the signals it generates to only when price is below bbands by making the following change:

elif i > 1:
                trade_signal.append('XXXXXXX'),
                
            #CHANGE TO#
            
elif i > 1:
                trade_signal.append(''),
