# StonkBot 99% finished. Just need to make it look pretty and export the data to an infographic instead of reading it manually from console.          
# The idea behind the bot is as follows: In an uptrend on any asset, there will be dips, those dips sometimes mark an exact bottom when %b goes below 0(outside below bbands). 
# This ONLY works in an uptrend. This is the strategy. Buy dips in uptrends.
# You need to manually determine trend, dont buy the dip in a downtrend. Need to figure out code for determining trend to further filter the results the bot generates.
